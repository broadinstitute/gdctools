# This config file is used by the GDCtools test_cases regression test. It limits
# the set of data downloaded/mirrored, to a single category and case, and shows
# how sections within a config file can be mixed & matched: here we show how the
# CASES config variable is inherited by the mirror tool, while the mirror tool
# ALSO sets the CATEGORIES variable explicitly.  Such variables can also be
# overridden from the command line, which has the highest precedence of all.
# [see GDCtool::config_finalize() for an exhaustive discussion of precedence]
# That fact is demonstrated by the --categories Biospecimen flag given in the
# Makefile having precedence over the DNA Methylation category defined below.
