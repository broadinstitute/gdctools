# This config file is meant to be used in conjunction with other, program-
# specific config files (like tcga.cfg); augmenting them so that, instead
# of generating loadfiles that refer to local storage they can instead 
# refer to buckets in Google cloud storage.  It is presumed that the act
# of populating the buckets (referenced in these Google loadfiles) happens
# outside of GDCtools proper.
#
# This configuration extends a core configuration by specifying an alternative
#
#   1) loadfile dir, to cleanly separate google-ified loadfiles from those
#      generated with references to local (on-premises) storage
#   2) PATH_PREFIX, so that each file referenced within the loadfile begins
#      with a Google bucket URI instead of path to local storage.  Usually
#      the PATH_PREFIX variable need not be mentioned in a [loadfiles] section,
#      as it defaults to the value of ROOT_DIR in the [dice] config section.
