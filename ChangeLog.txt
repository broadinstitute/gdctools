Version 0.2.13: (not released yet)
.  All tools now offer --show flag, to display key=value configuration state
.  CPTAC clinical files now processed with tsv2magetab in dicer to add sample ID
.  Added CPTAC3 disease study abbreviations
Version 0.2.12:
.  gdc_report now gracefully tolerates absence of a sample filter list
Version 0.2.11:
.  Updated CPTAC3 to re-enable WXS-based segfile converter isolated during merge
Version 0.2.10:
.  Initial support for CPTAC3
.  Updated regression test baselines to reflect latest GDC data
.  The --help output for gdc_list now gives several usage examples
Version 0.2.9:
.  Support new V2 seg files from GDC; update regression tests to latest data
   GDC data release, and ensure they are downloaded outside of repo directory
   tree so as to not slow down builds/installs
Version 0.2.8:
.  Install .cfg files to bin dir
.  Avoid mirroring pathology slides for now, as they are extremely large; issue
   #73 created so that this avoidance can happen via config files, instead
Version 0.2.6:
.  More spit-n-polish on the regression tests
.  Better segregation of FFPE samples by gdc_loadfile when creating sample sets
Version 0.2.5:
.  gdc_miror now longer exposes --date CLI arg; it was never relevant because
   the mirror creates datestamps
.  rest of tools more intelligently infer correct datestamp to use
.  gdc_loadfile now exposes --format arg, to choose between FireCloud/Firehose
   and generates case (participant/donor/individual) loadfiles in firecloud mode
Version 0.2.4:
.  Corrected file paths in files generated by gdc_loadfile
Version 0.2.3:
.  Misc tweaks arising from OPS testing
Version 0.2.2:
.  Major step forward in rationalizing interplay of CLI args and config files
.  Including definition of scopes, specificty & precedence in GDCtool.py
.  Tweaked some of the tests to demonstrate & test this interplay
.  Updated a few more baseline test datafiles that had lingering V6 content
Version 0.2.1
.  Changed paginated queries to begin at page=0 instead of page=1;
.  apparently in v1.9.0 the GDC API changed from 1-based to 0-based indexing?
Version 0.2.0
.  Re-establish usability with BOTH Python 2 and 3
.  Motivated by contributions from https://github.com/aswanipranjal
